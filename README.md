### Task Management Application

**Objective:**
Develop a full-stack task management application with a focus on frontend development using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The backend should be implemented using NestJS with TypeScript and should be designed to handle basic CRUD operations for task management. The application should be optimized for performance and scalability, and it should include user authentication and authorization.

**Requirements:**

- Implement the frontend using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- Implement the backend using NestJS with TypeScript.
- Design and implement RESTful APIs for managing tasks.
- Ensure the application is optimized for server-side rendering (SSR).
- Implement token-based authentication and authorization.
- Use Docker for containerization.
- Implement automated tests for both frontend and backend.
- Document the project, including setup, deployment instructions, and API documentation.

**Tasks:**

**Project Setup:**

1. **Create a new GitHub repository for the project.**
2. **Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.**
3. **Set up a NestJS project with TypeScript.**
4. **Initialize Docker configurations for both frontend and backend.**

**Frontend Development:**

1. **Design and implement the following components:**
   - Task List: Display a list of tasks.
   - Task Details: View detailed information about a specific task.
   - Create Task: Form to create a new task.
   - Edit Task: Form to edit an existing task.
   - Authentication: Login and registration forms.
2. **Ensure the application is responsive and follows clean coding practices.**
3. **Implement server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO.**
4. **Integrate the frontend with the backend APIs.**

**Backend Development:**

1. **Design and implement RESTful APIs for the following operations:**
   - Create a new task.
   - Retrieve task information by ID.
   - Update task information.
   - Delete a task.
   - List all tasks.
2. **Implement user authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).**
3. **Ensure proper validation and error handling for all endpoints.**

**Database Management:**

1. **Choose a suitable database (SQL or NoSQL) for storing task data.**
2. **Implement database models and data access layers.**
3. **Optimize database queries for performance.**

**Containerization:**

1. **Write Dockerfile(s) to containerize both the frontend and backend applications.**
2. **Ensure the applications can be run and tested locally using Docker.**

**Testing:**

1. **Write unit and integration tests for the backend APIs.**
2. **Write unit and integration tests for the frontend components.**
3. **Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run tests and deploy the applications.**

**Documentation:**

1. **Create a README file with project description, setup instructions, and usage guide.**
2. **Document the API endpoints using tools like Swagger or Postman.**
3. **Provide detailed deployment instructions for deploying the applications using Docker.**

**Code Review and Submission:**

1. **Push the code to the GitHub repository.**
2. **Ensure the repository is public or share access with the reviewer.**
3. **Submit the GitHub repository link along with any necessary credentials for accessing the deployed application.**

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- **Code Quality:** Clean, readable, and well-documented code.
- **API Design:** Efficient and scalable API design with proper validation and error handling.
- **Frontend Design:** Responsive and performant frontend with clean component architecture.
- **Security:** Proper implementation of authentication and authorization.
- **Containerization:** Successful containerization and ability to run the applications locally using Docker.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests.
- **Documentation:** Clear and thorough project and API documentation.

**Submission Instructions:**

1. **Fork the repository and create a branch named `develop`.**
2. **Complete the project as per the requirements.**
3. **Push the code to your GitHub repository.**
4. **Create a pull request to merge your `develop` branch into the `main` branch.**
5. **Submit the pull request link along with any relevant deployment credentials to **ramon@techisland.tech**.

**Project Deadline:**

The project must be completed and the pull request submitted by **[deadline date]**.
